              “Come Back Alive” is a Foundation providing competent assistance to the military. Since 2014, their key 
              goal has been to make the Defense Forces more efficient, save the lives of the military and systematically 
              counter the enemy. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, we have multiplied our military 
              assistance and supported the defenders of Ukraine, who have changed their everyday lives and joined the line of defense.

              “Come Back Alive” is the first charity organization in Ukraine that received a license for the purchase and import of 
              military and dual purpose goods. In particular, the team of the organization purchased and transferred to the units of 
              the Defense Forces a complex of the Bayraktar TB2 attack UAV, consisting of three drones, a ground station, guided 
              ammunition and other equipment, and 11 special armored vehicles.

              Their instructors train sappers, drone operators, artillerymen, and snipers, as well as teach pre-medical aid and 
              facilitate secret missions, which we will be sure to talk about after the victory.

              of Ukraine and trained over 10,000 highly qualified military specialists.
